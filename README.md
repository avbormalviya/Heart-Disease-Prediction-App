# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the risk of heart disease based on a patient's medical data. Built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, it demonstrates a complete ML pipeline ‚Äî from data cleaning and model training to deployment-ready UI.

## üìå Features

- Accepts key medical inputs: age, sex, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.
- Predicts the presence of heart disease using a trained Random Forest model
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- 85% accuracy on test data
- Code follows clean and modular ML pipeline practices

## üß† Machine Learning Overview

- **Dataset**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset
- **Target**: Binary classification ‚Üí `0 = No disease`, `1 = Disease`
- **Model**: `RandomForestClassifier` (tuned with sensible defaults)
- **Accuracy**: ~85% on held-out test set
